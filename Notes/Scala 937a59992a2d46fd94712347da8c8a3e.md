# Scala

- Glossary
    
    Compose is **a verb that describes the act of writing, creating, or putting something together.**
    

Scala code is converted to ByteCode and can be run on any device that has JVM installed, like Android or Computer

### Fundamentals of Scala

Compiler infers type, you dont need to specify types.

---

Allocating Constants, You cannot reassign. 

val name : Type = 42 OR val aBoolean = false  

val aString = “I Love Scala”

- What is String interpolation
    
    Injecting Values into Strings
    
- How to String interpolate ?
    
    s is important here.
    
    `val *anInterpolatedString* = s"The meaning of Life is **$***meaningOfLife*"`
    
- How to think in Scala ?
    
    > Think interms of expressions, values and not as set of instructions, if counter then increase.  How to think interms of values, think of composing values to get new values.
    > 
    
    > In Scala you dont use loops[Loops are extremely discouraged]. You use functions and recursion.
    > 
    
    Expressions are structures that can be reduced to values.
    
    val anExpression = 55; 
    
    In terinary operator, you cannot chain If else blocks.

- What are Code blocks? R
    
    Abstracting expressions in a block
    
    Type of Code block is infered.

- How to specify Abstract Class ?
    
    Some definitions do not need to be implemented, Who ever extends the abstract class can implement the method signatures.
    
    Private or Protected, when specified.

- What is an Trait?
    
    Ultimate abstract type, basically interfaces
    
    only functions, no values.
    
- Scala supports Single Class inheritance with multi class traits ?

- Operators in Scala are ?
    
    They are methods of Objects.

- What is a Singleton Object? How is the apply method used?
    
    **Note here Object is used instead of classes, Object is available as instance**

- What is a **Companion Object?**
    
    **Static fields in a class are abstracted to something called an Object**

- What are Case **classes** ?
    
    **Mostly used for pattern matching.**
    
    equals to enter into collections that is used to check equality
    
    Serialization is used to send data over a network.
    
    You can create case classes without a keyword new because, it has a companion object with an apply method.

- How to use Exceptions?
    
    Finally is used to close files, release resources that otherwise would have been dangerous.

- What is Generics ? How to use Generics?
    
    Generics is a form of templating.  T is a Type. T can be used as method definitions, value definitions. So during instances, they are concrete. 
    
    Reuse the same classes for multiple types. 
    
    Here MyList is the generic form used for list implementation in Scala.

- Key points for Object Oriented Programming ?
    
    ![Untitled](Scala%20937a59992a2d46fd94712347da8c8a3e/Untitled%2019.png)
    
    // Point #2 Scala is closest to the OO ideal. 
    
    If you notice, every method, expression is written mostly inside an object [Classes in Java]. 
    
- Why are we extending App ?
    
    Inherits the public static void main method, making the program runnable
    

### Functional Programming

Always remember that in Scala, we deal with Immutable Functions/ Objects

JVM does not know what function is as first class citizen. It was build for java, which was a prototypica OO language. 

- What is Functional Programming ?
    
    We would like to do what ever we could do with objects, on Functions as well. Which includes below. To do this Scala, invented **FunctionX.**

### Compose Functions

- Apply method revisited
    
    ![Untitled](Scala%20937a59992a2d46fd94712347da8c8a3e/Untitled%2021.png)
    
- How did Scala Developers make Functional Programming Possible?
    
    Apply method is the heart of functional programming. 
    
    > Here 22 is the max number of arguments that can be passed.
    > 
    
    Here Function1 denoted 1 arg, Function 2 denotes two args

- What is syntax sugar ?
    
    **Alternative code to replace boiler plate code.**

### Pass, Return Functions as args.

- What are higher order functions?
    
    Functions that take functions as args/returns functions as results or both. 
    
- How to iterate a list without a for loop?
    
    ```
    // Remember that we are dealing with Immutable Objects
    // Build a new Function by Applying a Function to each of the elements of the collection.
    valaMappedList: List[Int] = List(1,2,3).map(number => number + 1)
    println(aMappedList) //Prints List(2,3,4)
    ```
    
- How to make a new list with each element of a list?
    
    ```
    // Alternative Syntax to .map(x => List(x, x * 2)
    valFlatMappedList: List[Int] = List(1,2,3).flatMap { x =>
      List(x,2 * x)
    }
    println(FlatMappedList) //Prints List(1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6)
    ```
    
- How to filter a list without a for loop?
    
    ```
    valaFilteredList: List[Int] = List(1,2,3,4,5,6).filter(_ >= 3) // Equivalent to x => x >= 3)
    println(aFilteredList)
    ```
    
- How to combine clauses A.K.A nested for loop together?
    
    > List(1 -a, 1 -b, 1 -c, 2 -a, 2 -b, 2 -c, 3 -a, 3 -b, 3 -c)
    >

### Collections

Map, Filter, Flatmap work for all collections

---

- What is are common functions for lists?
    
    List does not support random access
    
    1. Head, Returns 1st element.
    2. Tail, Returns entire list, without first element.
- What is a : : operator ?
    
    It is a prepended operation.
    
    List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    
    ![Untitled](Scala%20937a59992a2d46fd94712347da8c8a3e/Untitled%2026.png)
    
- What is a +: or :+ operator?
    
    It is an appending operation.
    
    :+ to append to start
    
    :+ to append to end

- What is a Sequence ?
    
    **Like an array, advantage is random memory access.**

- What is a Set? What is its primary advantage?
    
    No Duplicates, used to check if element is contained in the set. Order is not important in a set collection. 
    
    ![Untitled](Scala%20937a59992a2d46fd94712347da8c8a3e/Untitled%2030.png)
    
- What is Range?
    
    Ficticious collections which does not contain elements. This is used for iteration, making collections with a particular formula.

- How to convert between collections?
    
    .toList, .toRange, and all other collections
    
- What is a Tuple?
